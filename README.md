# Navigating-the-Pok-mon-Maze-with-TurtleBot
Intelligent Robotics final project

## 1. Objective 

Use Turtlebot3 to grab Pokemons and walk out of the maze in Gazebo (because of the pandemic). You donâ€™t know what the maze looks like; it may be dangerous
(you should stand away from the maze without seeing it and not crash the wall). So, you send your turtlebot to explore the maze by remote control or
automatic control. Then grab some Pokemon (save some Pokemon images on your computer under some rules).

## 2. Tasks to do
(1) set up the maze and turtlebot in Gazebo

(2) let the turtlebot automatically explore the maze, find the exit, and get out of the maze

(3) keep a certain distance and angle to catch a Pokemon (If we can keep a Pokemon in the center of the red rectangle and fit the size well, it will be easily caught)

(4) do the above tasks as quickly as possible! (3 min or less!)

(5) catch as much Pokemon as possible! (6 or more!)

(6) bonus: if possible, use multiple turtlebots to complete the tasks.

## 3. environment
Ubuntu18.04 + ROS Melodic + Gazebo
